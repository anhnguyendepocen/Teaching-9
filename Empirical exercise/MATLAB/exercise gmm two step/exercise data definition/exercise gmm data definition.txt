Added July 29, 2013:

(1) For the variables handdum, handper, educ, and hsat missing values
    were imputed by gender-specific sample average values. Only the
    imputed values have more than 6 digits.

(2) In table 1 of the paper the appropriate counts for male hospital
    visits are

    for 3 visits        0.15
    for 4-9 visits      0.203
	
(3) The reference year in table 2 is 1984.
	
(4) Table 3: The labels yes and no are inverted for descriptives of
    males' values for the variables married and children in household.
    
(5) The variables handdum and handper are miscoded in 1987. The
    handdum indicator shows swapped values for 0 and 1. The handper
    variable was erroneously imputed.
	    
I apologize for any hassles this may (have) cause(d).
